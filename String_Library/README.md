## Custom String Library (C)

This repository contains a custom string library implemented in the C programming language. The library provides various functions for string manipulation, inspired by the standard `<string.h>` library.

## Features

- **String Manipulation:** Functions for common string operations such as concatenation, comparison, copying, searching, and conversion.
- **Error Handling:** Error-checking mechanisms to handle invalid input and ensure robust behavior.
- **Efficient Algorithms:** Implementations optimized for performance and memory efficiency.
- **Customizable:** Easily integrable into C projects, with flexibility for customization according to specific project requirements.

## Usage

To use the library in your C projects, simply include the appropriate header file and link against the library during compilation. See the provided examples and documentation for detailed usage instructions.
